## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Docker 20.10+
- Docker Compose 2.0+
- Python 3.8+

### Installation
```bash
## Prerequisites
- Docker Desktop ([Download](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop))


## Setup
```bash
# 1. Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/ImaneBenzegunine/GraphNest.git
cd GraphNest

# 2. Start OrientDB
docker-compose up -d

## Create a virtual environment:
‚úÖ 1. Create the virtual environment : In your project directory (where your Python files are), run:

python -m venv venv

This creates a virtual environment named venv.

‚úÖ 2. Activate the virtual environment

venv\Scripts\activate

‚úÖ 3. Install the requirements
Run the following command:


pip install -r requirements.txt


‚úÖ 4. Run your  project
Once all dependencies are installed, you can start your app (assuming it's in a file like app.py) using:

python Script.py

## Set up airflow with docker CMD
```bash
cd airflow
docker-compose up airflow-init
```bash
Open new terminal
```bash
docker-compose up
```bash
Open new terminal
```bash
docker ps
```bash
- to check the health of the created containers

On your broser open the port :
```bash
localhost:8080
```bash
